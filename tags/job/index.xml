      <description>My first work experience was in the summer of 2005 when I Just turned 16 and finished the second year of high school (or was about to be junior in high school).
Early that summer my father said:
Go get a job son, and start working on your own
But he never told me how to.
I was fond of technical stuff since I was a child.
So the only search algorithm for a job that came to my mind was walking in the streets near where we lived and looking for electrical shops, facilities, technical services, motor winding stores, etc.</description>
