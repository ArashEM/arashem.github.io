      <title>First Work Experience</title>

      <description>My first work experience was in the summer of 2005 when I Just turned 16 and finished the second year of high school (or was about to be junior in high school).
Early that summer my father said:
Go get a job son, and start working on your own
But he never told me how to.
I was fond of technical stuff since I was a child.
So the only search algorithm for a job that came to my mind was walking in the streets near where we lived and looking for electrical shops, facilities, technical services, motor winding stores, etc.</description>

      <description>Over about 10 years of being embedded system hobbyist I&amp;rsquo;d worked with various evaluation boards.
Here is short story of me and my evaluation boards!
Raspberrypi Model B It was around 1391 when I purchased this board. My first Linux board
I
 Learn about cross compile and mounting rootfs over NFS Read Embedded Linux Primer by Christopher Hallinan Read Embedded Linux training by bootlin  Tiny6410 In summer of 1393 I purchased this board from ECA eshop.</description>

      <description>Introduction VS1063 is an audio encoder/decoder from VLSI solution. Base on VS1063 and STM32F1X, I&amp;rsquo;d designed a simple MP3 player.
Specification Here is list of main element used in my MP3P project:
 VS1063a as MP3 / FLAC decoder STM32F103RCT6 as main controller Can be powered from USB and Li-ion battery (without interruption on exchange) TPS62110QRSARQ1 as switching regulator (3v7 to 3v3) MAX1555EZK Li-ion battery charger LTC4412ES6 Power Path controller SDIO 4bit connection (which only 1bit got working!</description>

      <description>Introduction One of my old dreams was about having personal server which is accessible over Internet.
So I could rent a VPS (Virtual Private Server).
But, It&amp;rsquo;s
 Expensive Expensive (again!) Not that private  So I build my own infrastructure based on old G41M motherboard.
Here is what I did.
Functional View Using Ubuntu-16.04 and Docker, I could have multiple services.
nginx-proxy helped to map each service to dedicated sub-domain.</description>

      <description>Introduction For implementation of my VP2S and VP2S2 personal server, I choose TL-MR6400 as 4G router.
As said in VP2S, my Static IP is provided by Shatel Mobile 4G SIM card.
Here is some tests and review I&amp;rsquo;ve done about this router.
Package Here is what you get after un-boxing.
Speed Test I did serval speed test (iperf) over LAN/WiFi.
Also Internet speed was tested.
During Internet test I had 4G link with RSRQ = -9dB.</description>

      <title>Stanley Trigger Action</title>

      <description>Introduction I was curious about how long Trigger Action can keep water temperature. So I prepared a setup in order to measure temperature profile. Here is what I&amp;rsquo;d done.
Setup Main items in my setup include following items
 ESP8266 with Micropython firmware as central procession unit Water proof DS18b20 connected to ESP8266 over W1 bus. I used very thin wire for connection so I can close the hat putty terminal as logging agent  Here is my setup (Not a very good picture, I know)</description>

      <title>EPCI</title>

      <description>Introduction I always had a dream about HW/SW co-design of network controller. Like designing schematic / PCB, then develop FW/SW and so on &amp;hellip;
This is basically just a dream. But for my first iteration I&amp;rsquo;d decided to design a PCI network card.
As PCI is parallel (and a little simple) protocol, so I can handle (hopefully) hardware part of network card in LX9!
Again, my design can be as simple as 2 layer PCB.</description>

      <description>Introduction SAM9-EVAL is an evaluation board based on at91sam9260 Atmel SoC. It has an old ARM926EJS core. But because of it QFP208 package, you can have your own evaluation board with simple 2 layer PCB.
That&amp;rsquo;a what I&amp;rsquo;ve done!
Specification  AT91SAM9260 SoC (ARM926EJS core) 64 Mbytes SDRAM 256 Mbytes NAND flash 4 Mbytes Atmel Data Flash DP83848 Ethernet physical layer FT232BL USB to serial converter ÂµSD card slot  History First version of board (V1.</description>
