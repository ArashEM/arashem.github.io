      <description>Introduction VS1063 is an audio encoder/decoder from VLSI solution. Base on VS1063 and STM32F1X, I&amp;rsquo;d designed a simple MP3 player.
Specification Here is list of main element used in my MP3P project:
 VS1063a as MP3 / FLAC decoder STM32F103RCT6 as main controller Can be powered from USB and Li-ion battery (without interruption on exchange) TPS62110QRSARQ1 as switching regulator (3v7 to 3v3) MAX1555EZK Li-ion battery charger LTC4412ES6 Power Path controller SDIO 4bit connection (which only 1bit got working!</description>

      <description>Introduction One of my old dreams was about having personal server which is accessible over Internet.
So I could rent a VPS (Virtual Private Server).
But, It&amp;rsquo;s
 Expensive Expensive (again!) Not that private  So I build my own infrastructure based on old G41M motherboard.
Here is what I did.
Functional View Using Ubuntu-16.04 and Docker, I could have multiple services.
nginx-proxy helped to map each service to dedicated sub-domain.</description>

      <description>Introduction I always had a dream about HW/SW co-design of network controller. Like designing schematic / PCB, then develop FW/SW and so on &amp;hellip;
This is basically just a dream. But for my first iteration I&amp;rsquo;d decided to design a PCI network card.
As PCI is parallel (and a little simple) protocol, so I can handle (hopefully) hardware part of network card in LX9!
Again, my design can be as simple as 2 layer PCB.</description>

      <description>Introduction SAM9-EVAL is an evaluation board based on at91sam9260 Atmel SoC. It has an old ARM926EJS core. But because of it QFP208 package, you can have your own evaluation board with simple 2 layer PCB.
That&amp;rsquo;a what I&amp;rsquo;ve done!
Specification  AT91SAM9260 SoC (ARM926EJS core) 64 Mbytes SDRAM 256 Mbytes NAND flash 4 Mbytes Atmel Data Flash DP83848 Ethernet physical layer FT232BL USB to serial converter ÂµSD card slot  History First version of board (V1.</description>
